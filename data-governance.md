# Data Governance 
Data governance establishes policies, roles, and accountability to maintain data quality throughout its lifecycle. A robust governance framework includes: 

Policies and Standards: Clear guidelines for data collection, storage, and sharing that align with regulatory requirements like HIPAA. 
Role Definition: Assigning responsibilities for data stewardship and quality assurance to ensure adherence to established policies. 
Monitoring and Auditing: Regular audits to identify discrepancies and ensure continuous compliance with data standards. Data governance ensures consistent practices across an organization by fostering accountability and transparency.
